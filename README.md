## About the project

### Problem

As Innopolis University students we noticed the lack of time problem while preparing to the exams. Students try to find the materials used by previous years for exam preparation in telegram chats to use their time more efficient.

### Solution

So, we introduce an application that will store the materials for exam preparation.

It is a crowdsourcing educational application aimed towards Innopolis University students. The app is directed to ease the process of the material assimilation and exam preparation.

The idea is to store the courses material in the form of cards, where one side is a question, another - answer.
